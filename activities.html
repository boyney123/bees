<p>Busy Bees Pre-school adheres to the Statutory Framework for the Early Years Foundation Stage as set out by the Department for Education and we are regulated by Ofsted</p>
<p>We use the early learning goals and their developmental stages to help us to track each child’s progress and to enable us to provide the right activities to help your child move towards achievement of the early learning goals.</p>
<p>Our Staff create an indoor and outdoor environments that provides a wide range of experiences and opportunities to explore. They plan prepare and organise activities based on observations of childrens learning, and the aims of the early learning goals.</p>
<p>We structure the indoor and outdoor environments to reflect children’s individual strengths, interests, abilities and needs.</p>
<p>We aim to continually extend children’s learning and development, giving children choices to build on and challenge their knowledge and understanding.</p>
<p>We have a lovely secure outside area which is directly connected to the indoor area which provides ease of access throughout the day.</p>
<p>We have paved and bark areas, large fixed play equipment and two large digging boxes. The children have a play house and a den.</p>
<p>We have a separate planting area to the side of the building, nicknamed ‘The Secret Garden’ by the children. Here, we grow fruit, vegetables, herbs and flowers, to teach about growth and decay. The children explore bugs and minibeasts in our log pile and compost.</p>
